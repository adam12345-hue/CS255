# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
# My client for the DriverPass project was the customer. I wanted to create a system to where student drivers could obtain their drivers license and schedule appointments with registered drivers ed instructors. Additionally I gave the client learning materials to help them for their paper test.
# What did you do particularly well?
# I think I did well in making sure the students had the help they needed as I gave the students the option to contact customer support and obtain information from various sources on the site.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
# I  would revise the payment side of my work. I would give the option to go on a payment plan if the student did not have the funds.
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
# I wrote down what the students would need and some safety procedures I thought would be important. For this project making sure the client had the correct education and a safe place to work is key.
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
# I made sure to include requirement, student needs and safety into my project. I would spend more time on the financial side of the project for next time.
